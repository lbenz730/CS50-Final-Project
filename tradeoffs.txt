1a. The problem is searching for a needle in a haystack. One method (X) is binary search, while the other method (Y) is linear 
    search.

1b. The advantage that binary search has over linear search is that binary search tends to have a faster run time. Binary search has
    run time O(log n) while linear search has run time O(n). 

1c. The advantage that linear search has over binary search is that it doesn't require its input be sorted. Binary search requires
    its input to be sorted, which might require more than linear time. Moreover, binary search also needs its input to be randomly
    accessible.

2a. The problem is storing data. One method (X) is an array, while the other method (Y) is a linked list.

2b. The advantage that an array has over a linked list is that it stores data contiguously and allows for random access, making
    lookup operations run in constant time. Linked lists on the other hand do not allow for random access, and many operations
    tend to run in linear time rather than constant time. Another advantage of arrays is that they take up less space than linked
    lists, which require additional space to store pointers linking nodes.

2c. The advantage that a linked list has over an array is that unlike an array, it is not a fixed size. The size of a linked link
    can grow and shrink as necessary because its memory is dynamically allocated. In order to augment or decrease the size of an 
    array, one would have to create a whole new array, and copy the correct values into their new indicies, which is much more 
    complicated than altering the size of a linked list.
