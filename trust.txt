= Trusting `clang`

== Answers

1.  In order to represent \N as an additional new line character, I would include the following line of code. 
    
    if(c == 'N')
        return(10);
    
    Note that the ASCII value for a new line character in decimal is 10.
    

2.  One should not trust clang even though it is open source (and we can inspect that source code) because if there were a trojan 
    horse, it would likely be impossible to detect in the source code. Trojan horses could be introduced into a source code, and 
    compiled into a bugged binary. Even after the trojan horses were removed from the source code (ie no record of their presence
    in the source code), the new bugged binary will reinsert the bugs whenever the source code is compiled. Thus, trojan horses
    can still be present with no trace in the source code.
    
    Even if you compiled clang yourself, you still can't trust it. The underlying binary of clang could be bugged, so even compiling 
    it yourself doesn't guarentee bug free code. Thompson's point is that you can't truly trust code unless you create every single
    aspect of that code yourself. Since compiling the code youself still relies on some code generated by someone else (and thus 
    could havea bug in the underlying binary), you can't trust clang even if you compile it yourself.
