1. A stateless algorithim is an algorithim that always produces the same output each time the same input is entered. Stateless
algorithms can't respond to patterns in the data overtime. Stateful algorithms on the other hand, are algorithms that learn from
their calculations, and update to respond to patterns in the data over. Rather than simply predicting one letter based on the 
previous letter (ie. always guessing 'e' will come after 't'), the autocomplete keyboard algorithim adjusts its predictions based on
the context of what the user is typing, and the user's word history. Beucase the autocomplete algorithim updates itself after each 
calculation, and uses saved data to improve and make better predictions, we say that it is stateful.

2. One pattern that a good machine-learning algorithm should recognize once trained is that pipes (P) are always represented using 
exactly two columns of identical height. Another pattern that the algorithm should recognize once trained is that each row of text
is the same length, and each column of text is the same length (ie. text is a perfect rectange of characters).Finally, the 
algorithim should recognize that the bottom of a pipe must rest on a block (the lowest P should be directly above =). 

3. A machine learning model/algorithim can only be as good as the amount of data that it is trained on. To make a really high 
quality machine learning algorithim, one needs an enormous amount of data. It would be impossible to have access to as much search
data on which to train my algorithims as Google does. Even if I were to use the same algorithms as Google for my CS50 final project, 
I wouldn't be able to train my algorithms with enough data for them to be as effective as Google's search engine.
