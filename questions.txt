0.  <stdint.h> is a header file that defines the size of certain integer types and sets limits on the minimun and maximum values 
    that these integer types can be.
1.  Using uint8_t, uint32_t, int32_t, and uint16_t in a program allows the user to create data structures of a fixed size 
    (fixed number of bits). uint8_t is an unsigned 8-bit integer, which bpm.h uses to create the size of the constant BYTE. 
    Thus, using these fixed sizes of memory allows us to create new data structures and give it a certain amount of memory.
2.  BYTE is one byte, DWORD and LONG are both four bytes, and WORD is two bytes.
3.  The first two bytes must represent the characters BM. In ASCII, this is 66, 77. In Hexidecimal, this is 0x42, 0x4D.
4.  bfSize is the total number of bytes used in a bitmap file, while biSize is the total number of bytes used by the 
    structure BITMAPINFOHEADER.
5.  If biHeight is negative, this means that the image is top down and the origin of the image is the upper left corner.
6.  The field biBitCount in BITMAPINFOHEADER specifiecs teh color depth of the image.
7.  fopen() might return NULL is lines 24 and 32 of copy.c because the mode = "r" (reading). If the file doesn't exist than 
    fopen() will return NULL.
8.  The third argument of fread() is always 1 because we are reading in the entire BITMAPINFOHEADER and only want to read
    that number of bits once. There is no reason why to read in more bits since those further bits would be outside of 
    BITMAPINFOHEADER.
9.  If bi.biWidth is 3, line 65 will return 3 to padding.
10. fseek is a function that offsets the the pointer of a file by a certain amount, thus keeping track of where in the file
    we are.
11. SEEK_CUR is a constant signifying the current position of the file's pointer.
