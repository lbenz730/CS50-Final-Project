0. The framework provided allows games of size dxd provided that d is between 3 and 9 inclusive.
1. The game's board is represented in a two dimensional array.
2. The function greet() is called at the beginning to greet the user and welcome them to the game.
3. I need to implement four functions. They are init(), draw(), move(), and win().
